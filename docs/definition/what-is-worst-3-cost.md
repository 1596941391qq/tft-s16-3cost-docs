# What is a 3-Cost Unit in TFT (Set 16)?

In Teamfight Tactics (TFT) Set 16, a **3-cost unit** refers to any champion that costs **3 gold** to purchase from the shop.

3-cost units typically appear during the **mid-game phase** and serve as a crucial bridge between early-game tempo units and late-game carries.

## Why 3-Cost Units Matter

Compared to 1-cost and 2-cost units, 3-cost champions usually offer:

- Stronger base stats and scaling
- More impactful abilities
- Key synergies that define mid-game compositions

At the same time, they are significantly easier to upgrade than 4-cost or 5-cost units, making them a popular choice for stabilizing boards during Stage 3 and Stage 4.

## When to Build Around 3-Cost Units

Players often build around 3-cost units when:

- They hit multiple copies early
- The unit fits naturally into their active traits
- The lobby tempo punishes greedy late-game strategies

Because of this balance between power and accessibility, 3-cost units are some of the **most strategically flexible champions** in TFT Set 16.
